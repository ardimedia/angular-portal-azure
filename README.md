# angular-portal-azure

A HTML framework for building a Azure Portal style web site.

Very early preview.

This is a Framework for building UI system, based on the behavior of Azure portal.
You will get the same user experience as in the Azure portal.
You will be able to fill areas and panes with your content.

## Roadmap

We are in the process of migrating to Angular 2. The following are our Github repositories:

**azureportalstyleng**: This is the first `angular portal azure`-style version, based on Angular 1.

**angular-portal-azure**: We try to migrate from Angular 1 to Angular 2 and still be compatible with our first version.

**angular-portal-azure.new**: If ``angular-portal-azure`` does not come out good, we will forget about compatibility and move to a brand new version.
